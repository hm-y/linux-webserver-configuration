# linux-webserver-configuration

### UDACITY FSND Part 5: Project Description

> **Project Overview**  
> You will take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host your web applications. You will secure your server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of your existing web applications onto it.  
>   
> **Why this Project?**  
> A deep understanding of exactly what your web applications are doing, how they are hosted, and the interactions between multiple systems are what define you as a Full Stack Web Developer. In this project, you’ll be responsible for turning a brand-new, bare bones, Linux server into the secure and efficient web application host your applications need.  
>   
> **What will I Learn?**  
> You will learn how to access, secure, and perform the initial configuration of a bare-bones Linux server. You will then learn how to install and configure a web and database server and actually host a web application.  
>   
> **How does this Help my Career?**  
> - Deploying your web applications to a publicly accessible server is the first step in getting users  
> - Properly securing your application ensures your application remains stable and that your user’s data is safe
